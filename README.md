- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a CS PhD student at City University of Hong Kong. I am generally interested in computer vision, graphics and machine learning. My recent research focuses on the representation and generation of objects/scenes for 3D and 4D content creation.
I am fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. [Jing LIAO](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=3s9f9VIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). I am mentored by [Guandao Yang](https://www.guandaoyang.com/), [Ziyu Wan](http://raywzy.com/), [Can Wang](https://cassiepython.github.io/) and [Hang Zhou](https://ryanhangzhou.github.io/) whose help and support I cannot appreciate enough.
- :satellite: Before that, I learned astrophyics at USTC.
